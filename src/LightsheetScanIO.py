#       1. Check all folders in "scans" directory to ensure integrity of folder structure. If there     #
#               is an integrity issue, show an item by item picture/description showing which items     #
#               in the structure are correct and which are incorrect/missing.                           #
#                                                                                                       #
#       2. Parse and load the entire state of each folder into a LightsheetScan.                        #
#       3. Save state of LightsheetScan to folder.                                                      #
